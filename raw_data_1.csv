812,Television highlights.,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE PLAYER (1992) In this film directed by Robert Altman, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), the head of production at a large Hollywood studio, tries to fend off a young genius (Peter Gallagher) rumored to have been hired as his replacement while figuring out who is writing him poison-pen postcards. When the hate mail’s author — a screenwriter (Vincent D’Onofrio) Griffin failed to get back to — turns up dead, he becomes a suspect, partly for falling in love with the writer’s girlfriend (Greta Scacchi, above, with Mr. Robbins). Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett play the detectives who make Griffin squirm. “As a satire, ‘The Player’ tickles,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. “It doesn’t draw blood.” Mr. Altman’s most subversive message, he added, “is not that it’s possible to get away with murder in Hollywood, but that the most grievous sin, in Hollywood terms anyway, is to make a film that flops.” In “Short Cuts” (1993), at 10:15, Mr. Altman intertwines the experiences of Los Angelenos in adaptations of Raymond Carver stories. Mr. Robbins reappears as a philandering motorcycle cop who can’t be faithful to the woman (Frances McDormand) with whom he’s cheating on his wife (Madeleine Stowe). Lily Tomlin is a diner cook who hits a small boy with her car. Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell are his parents; Mr. Lovett is the baker who makes his birthday cake. Fred Ward, Buck Henry and Huey Lewis are three pals who find a dead woman while fishing. And Jennifer Jason Leigh is a mother who supports her family by doing phone sex, sometimes while washing dishes or changing diapers. “The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done,” Mr. Canby wrote. “When future social historians want to know what the temper of life was like in one corner of America in 1993, ‘Short Cuts’ will be a mother lode of information. It’s also a terrific movie.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/arts/television/whats-on-tuesday.html,2013-08-20,article,Culture
